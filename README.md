Sampler - Toolkit for Simulation Modelling
==========================================

Sampler is Scala library of tools for simulation modelling, used at the Animal and Plant Health Agency.  Core features include:
* Type classes to create and manipulate empirical distributions.
* Approximation of posterior distributions using a distributed 'Approximate Bayesian Computation' algorithm.
* Interaction with R by calling a child process or linking with an R server.
